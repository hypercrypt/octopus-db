- Run `php octo octopus/import` to import the data

REQUIRES
--------

- MySQL (Other databses not tested)

KOWN ISSUES
-----------

- Gas usage is still work in progress
- Bright will import gas in kWh,
  Octopus will import in kWh for SMETS1 and mÂ³ for SMETS2. 
  Curently the records will be mixed in the database.
- Data for evey tariff you've ever been on will be imported in perpetuity
